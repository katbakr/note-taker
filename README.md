  ## Description
   An application made to make note keeping easier than ever. All notes are stored on a server ran by Express. This application uses basic front end languages, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. The user can use this application to enter notes for themself that will persist every time they open the page and only disappear when deleted using the trash can next to their note. This web page was developed to help me develop my understanding and skills using Express and database data. 


  ## Usage
  To use this app, you will need to navigate from the landing page to the notes page by clicking the "Get Started" button. This will bring you to your notes storage area. In here, you can use the right collumn to add a title and note data to a note, and press the save button in the upper right corner to save the note. Once saved, the note will appear on the left collumn with all other saved notes. Notes can be easily deleted using the red garbage can button. Careful using that though because those notes cannot be recovered!
